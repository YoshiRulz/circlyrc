## Circulyr

Circulyr is markup for lyrics, going above and beyond what most wiki lyric databases use.

In summary:
- [v:] for version (required);
- [x#] for repetitions, as expected;
- [r:] for reference, [s:] for stop (end reference), [g:] for goto;
- [p:] for partial reference, [s:] for stop, [q:] for short goto;
- [t:] for translation;
- [b:] for break, [c:] for comment, [f:] for fx, [m:] for movement.

Examples are included in the `examples/` directory. If the songs' copyright holder, Andrew Huang, decides he doesn't want me republishing his lyrics then I'll make up my own examples.
