[r: Chorus]
Too many lights at the ball /
Trying to flicker, glitter, shimmer, shine
Too many kids at the bar /
Yelling 'bout their wasted time
Too many heads at the show
O- o- oh, c'mon, I got /
Too many dreams, don't you know
So baby let's get away
[s:]

You know I've been waking up /
Falling in love over and over with you
Trying not think too much /
'Cause then I think of you and I know I'll miss you
Could it be a new day?
I'm trying to get you away /
From the same old things /
And a life held back - won't you come out and play?

[g: Chorus]

Venice beach, with these vendors having turf wars
Kids balling in this heat like the Earth's core
But I'd ditch the best storm for the worst shore /
You, me, sangrias and a surfboard
You know I never liked a crowd much
Got big love and big ideas to round up
And when I'm with you anything goes, but /
Oh, how I'd like to get you alone; so now what, now what?

I'm saying walk with me, talk with me
I want to be with you constantly
We shine together, no matter how far
Can't have constellations without stars
Come alive, this is summertime
I'm overheated and I'm underdimed
But you're the finest thing I'm coming by
Let's get away, don't need to wonder why

[g: Chorus]
Baby let's get away
