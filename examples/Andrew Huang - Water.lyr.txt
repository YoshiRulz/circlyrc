Sink or swim again, I'll give you my hand
'Til we reach the end there's never dry land

[r: Pre-chorus]
We'll catch a glimpse of light
When the stars are out tonight
We can make it there, we can make it all alright

Might drift until we die /
And reflect that lonely sky
But I'm fine if I just have you by my side
[s:]

[r: Chorus]
I made you a promise
I'll keep though we are just /
Two bodies of water
[s:]

Cold as ice again - you won't come around
I can be your friend, but you want to drown

[g: Pre-chorus]

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

But you wanna drown [x3]
