[v: 0.4 | 1]

I give you all I can
You just take from me
The warmth of all your touch /
For a moment, then you leave

[r: Chorus]
While you're making your love
I'll be waiting alone
[s:]

I'm waiting at your heart
You won't let me in
I dream of what might be /
If you didn't have him

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

Could you believe in me?
Could you ever be with me?
[x2]

Could you believe in me? (If I could give you what you need, if you could give me what I need)
Could you ever be with me? (If I could give you what you need, if you could give me what I need)
[x4]

[g: Chorus]
[x2]

While you're making your love (If I could give you what you need, if you could give me what I need)
I'll be waiting alone (If I could give you what you need, if you could give me what I need)
While you're making your love (If I could give you what you need, if you could give me what I need)
I'll be waiting...
